Yesterday, I did nothing but watching NBA games on TV because it was Sunday. I thought it would be a nice day; however,
I found that I had to turn in a essay tomorrow before I went to sleep. After I typed 300 words, my laptop was out of order
because I accidentally spilt the coffee on it. What a terrible day!
